## Introduction

This Juncture essay illustrates the use of a few markdown formatting tags and the incorporation of an image and a map into a Juncture essay.

Owls are interesting and complex creatures. This one isn't real. The owls are not what they seem. The owls are not what they seem. The owls are not what they seem. The owls are not what they seem.

## Aulacophora indica

The image depicts a leaf beetle (Aulacophora indica) (Family: Chrysomelidae; subfamily: Galerucinae) looking out from a leaf hole of Alnus nepalensis tree. Adult leaf beetles make holes in host plant leaves while feeding. They camouflage themselves with these holes.

## More image

Image controls are located in the top-left corner of the image and can be seen when hovering over the image.  These controls support image zoom, rotation, full-screen viewing, and repositioning to the start position.  Panning can be performed with keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.

Image information can be seen when hovering the cursor over the info icon located in the top-right corner of the image.  The Image information popover includes the image title, description, attribution statement, and reuse rights.

### Chitwan National Park, Nepal

The map is centered on the Chitwan National Park in Nepal, which is the location associated with the image above.  The Wikidata identifier for Chitwan National Park is `Q1075023`.  When a map location is specified using a Wikidata ID (or QID) Juncture can automatically retrieve the geographic coordinates for map centering.

An alternative to using a Wikidata identifier for map positioning is to use regular latitude and longitude coordinates.  In that approach the QID would be replaced with the coordinates `27.5,84.333`, resulting in an identical map.

Similar to the image viewer, map zooming is controlled using the buttons located in the top-left corner of the map viewer.  Panning is performed with the keyboard arrow keys or by mouse click-and-drag.

### More options

"I am so sorry for you, Alan," he murmured, "but you leave me no alternative. I have a letter written already. Here it is. You see the address. If you don't help me, I must send it. If you don't help me, I will send it. You know what the result will be. But you are going to help me. It is impossible for you to refuse now. I tried to spare you. You will do me the justice to admit that. You were stern, harsh, offensive. You treated me as no man has ever dared to treat me--no living man, at any rate. I bore it all. Now it is for me to dictate terms."

### History

Campbell buried his face in his hands, and a shudder passed through him.

### Accidents

"No, Alan, you must not leave the house. Write out on a sheet of notepaper what you want and my servant will take a cab and bring the things back to you."

### Present & Future

"Yes, it is my turn to dictate terms, Alan. You know what they are. The thing is quite simple. Come, don't work yourself into this fever. The thing has to be done. Face it, and do it."
