excerpt: "The Chernobyl disaster inspired many variations on the fictional creature of radiation victims turned monsters."
description: "Thirty-four years ago on April 26th, reactor number four at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant exploded and released an immense amount of radiation into what is known today as the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone. The effects of radiation inspired many fictional pieces revolving around Chernobyl. This created the fictional creature of individuals affected by radiation now turned into violent monsters. Though, these monsters are far from the reality of what radiation does to life."
