title:  "Children of Chernobyl: Remembrance through Street Art"
category: ['pop']
excerpt: "Street art is an avenue for message broadcasting, which often speaks for the disenfranchised . "
description: "Although Pripyat, the city nearest to the Chernobyl disaster, has been abandoned by its citizens, the city carries on. A way in which it achieves this is through artists' contributions to the city, specifically street art murals. Street Art is meant to be viewed, and keeping in mind the fact that Pripyat is a subject of political and social discourse, the artists most likely intended to convey a message about Pripyat's history. There are certain themes found among the murals that the artists look for Pripyat visitors to reflect upon, such as shadows of people and children illustrations. "
