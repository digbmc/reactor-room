## Excerpt from *Voices From Chornobyl* by Svetlana Alexievich

> “Because this wasn’t just an ordinary cancer, which everyone is already afraid of, but Chernobyl cancer, even worse. The doctors told me: if the tumors had metastasized within his body, he’d have died quickly, but instead they crawled upward, along the body, to the face. Something black grew on him. His chin went somewhere, his neck disappeared, his tongue fell out. His veins popped, he began to bleed. From his neck, his cheeks, his ears. To all sides. I’d bring cold water, put wet rags against him, nothing helped. It was something awful, the whole pillow would be covered in it. I’d bring a washbowl from the bathroom, and the streams would hit it, like into a milk pail. That sound, it was so peaceful and rural. Even now I hear it at night. While he was still conscious, if he started clapping, that was our sign: Call the ambulance. He didn’t want to die. He was forty-five years old. I’d call the ambulance, and they know us, they don’t want to come: “There's nothing we can do for your husband." Just give him a shot! Some narcotic. I learned how to do it myself, but the shot […]” (130)


## Excerpt from "ARS And Skin Damage in Chornobyl Patients" by Gerard Wagemaker

> “Among the victims of the Chernobyl accident were people who were accidentally exposed to high doses of radiation. Such high dose exposures — which acutely and severely affect blood cell production, resistance against infections, and intestinal functions — may result in severe damage to the skin. The complex of disease symptoms from such exposures is known as "acute radiation syndrome", or ARS. Its most common symptoms are initially nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and, later on, bleeding and generalized infections with high fever, often caused by micro-organisms that are normally not harmful. If untreated, ARS is lethal, even following radiation doses which are not necessarily incompatible with survival of the human organism and are regularly used in clinical medicine to treat some forms of cancer. In an accident situation, the radiation damage is frequently even more complicated by other injury, such as thermal burns (29).”


## Excerpt from "The Real Chernobyl: Q&A With a Radiation Exposure Expert" by Nicoletta Lanese

> “Large doses of radiation could affect a number of systems in the body that are necessary for survival. Patients with ARS could develop a bone marrow syndrome, which suppresses their immunity, or a gastrointestinal syndrome, which could lead to damage to the lining of the intestines and associated infection, dehydration, and electrolyte imbalance. Then, a couple days later, the circulatory system collapses so people start having blood volume issues and so forth. The whole body is essentially collapsing (np).”
