title:  "Conflicting Truths: Exploring the Conspiracy Theories of Chernobyl"
category: ['pop']
excerpt: "This project examines Chernobyl conspiracy theories and their consequences for how we understand large-scale tragedies. "
description: "The following project aims to analyze Chernobyl conspiracies, specifically ones originating from Soviet Russia, Ukraine, and the United States, in an attempt to trace their origins and explore their deeper consequences for how we understand any instance of large-scale tragedy. This project argues that although conspiracy theories muddle the truth of tragic events, allowing a lack of accountability and making it more difficult to prevent such events from happening again, there is value in analyzing their origins and meanings. Conspiracy theories shouldn't necessarily be considered truthful, however, they can provide insight into the emotional responses victims of tragic events have."
