How does Chernobyl play into broader themes such as environmental degradation and how do artists use Chernobyl as a symbol in works with greater political or social meaning? "

## Introduction

Unsurprisingly, it's very common for artists of all kinds to engage in
conversation with pressing political themes and current events.
Chernobyl, although having occurred in Ukraine, had significance well
beyond national borders and has taken on symbolic cultural meaning
reflective of the fears of the time. In addition to literature, poetry,
and visual art, and film, there has also been music both recent and from
past decades which reference or draw upon themes from Chernobyl. I
believe it's significant to look at how Chernobyl is referenced in works
of music as it is representative of the broad cultural impact of
Chernobyl both within and outside of Ukraine.


## Eastern Europe

### "Sweet People" - Alyosha (2010)

"Sweet People" is by Ukrainian singer Alyosha and was the entry of
Ukraine in 2010 at the Eurovision Song Contest. Although her song
doesn't have a specific mention of Chernobyl, it is an emotional cry to
environmental action and her music video is shot entirely in the
abandoned city of Pripyat. In her lyrics, she sings <span class="soundcite" data-url="../../assets/audio/alyosha-sweet-people.m4a" data-start="0" data-end="27402" data-plays="1"> "Don\'t turn all the earth to stone/ Because, because, because/This is your home/Oh, sweet people/What about our children?"</span> In an interview during the Eurovision
Song Contest, Alyosha said that "The disaster at the Chornobyl nuclear
power plant is one of the darkest pages in the history of my country,
but there are "*Chernobyls*" waiting to happen and calling for urgent
action on the global level in many other nations worldwide. We turned to
the emotive images of Chernobyl in our video because they are a very
powerful reminder of what negligence, irresponsibility and inaction of
"*sweet people*" can lead to."

### "Collection of Songs About Chernobyl" - Sergei Uryyin (1986)

<span class="soundcite" data-id="807734299" data-start="0" data-end="19017" data-plays="1">"Collection of Songs About Chernobyl"</span> are a series of short songs in folk style sung in Russian by Sergei Uryyin. One of his songs which roughly translates to "What is impossible in Chernobyl," he sings "Chernobyl - I tell you, my friends/The capital of worldly temptations,/Which cannot be succumbed to." This represents the fact that despite Chernobyl having seemed normal and full of available food and other "temptations" following the accident, everything was much more dangerous than the eye could register due to the unseen force of deadly radiation permeating the air. Uryyin's work is not immensely popular or famous but is one of the few works in Russian that references the tragedy.

### *Chornobyl Songs Project: Living Culture from a Lost World*  <br/> - Ensemble Hilka (2015)

<span class="soundcite" data-id="819838000" data-start="6617" data-end="30067" data-plays="1">*Chornobyl Songs Project: Living Culture from a Lost World*</span> is a collection of songs released by Smithsonian Folkways which contains folk songs in the traditional style of those that would have been sung in the region surrounding Chernobyl. In this sense, it is an attempt to commemorate a culture's traditional music because of the displacement of the people in the Polissian region and the "resurgent interest in traditional music (such as the songs produced in this album) during and after the waning years of the Soviet Union" (Musacchia 115).

## Outside of Eastern Europe

### "Time Will Crawl" - David Bowie (1987)

David Bowie's "Time Will Crawl," released in 1987, is about the environmental destruction of the planet and Bowie has said that it was made in inspiration from Chernobyl. He was in Switzerland at the time of the disaster and has said in an interview that "huge billowing clouds were moving over from the Motherland and they weren\'t rain clouds... For those first few moments it felt sort of claustrophobic to know you were one of only a few witnesses to something of this magnitude... Over the next couple of months a complicated crucible of impressions collected in my head prompted by this insanity, any one of which could have become a song. I stuck them all in \'Time Will Crawl.\'\"[^1] The song is a protest of negative environmental impact caused by industry and the lyrics from the song which seem to draw upon Chernobyl specifically are <span class="soundcite" data-url="../../assets/audio/bowie-time-will-crawl.m4a" data-start="0" data-end="27402" data-plays="1">"I felt a warm warm breeze/ That melted metal and steel/ I got a bad migraine/ That lasted three long years."</span> These lines reference the cloud of radiation, or the "warm breeze," which would have affected Bowie at the time he was in Switzerland.

### "Chernobyl" - The Blue Hearts (1991)

The Blue Hearts was a Japanese punk rock band and "Chernobyl" was a statement against nuclear power with the line <span class="soundcite" data-id="807792457" data-start="0" data-end="27402" data-plays="1"> "I don't want to go to Chernobyl"</span> in the chorus; the inclusion of the song in their album was controversial and forced them to leave their record label, which had a sponsor invested heavily in nuclear energy.

### "Radioactivity" - Kraftwerk (1991)

<span class="soundcite" data-id="807739309" data-start="0" data-end="23275" data-plays="1">"Radioactivity,"</span> by German electronic band Kraftwerk, was released before Chernobyl in 1976 but re-recorded in 1991 a clearer anti-nuclear attitude and specific inclusion of Chernobyl's name. The fact that artists from all over the world were inspired to make work inspired by or in reference to Chernobyl and nuclear energy demonstrates the wide breadth of its global reverberations.

## Conclusion

These works of music come from different places around the world,
including Japan and Germany, demonstrating the broad transnational
memory of Chernobyl. It is also necessary to point out that some of
these works were created more for artistic value or entertainment rather
than to be made with representative knowledge of the tragedy of
Chernobyl and its victims. However, it's notable that these particular
works of music demonstrate Chernobyl's relevance in history and culture
and there are still many pertinent themes and messages to be drawn from
the lyrics. The works produced outside of Eastern Europe are "Time Will
Crawl" and "Chernobyl, 1985" from the US, and "Chernobyl" from Japan.
David Bowie's "Time Will Crawl," and The Blue Hearts' "Chernobyl" were
both produced in the 80s and reflect the anti-nuclear sentiment of the
time period. The works produced outside of Eastern Europe reflect the
experience of the political and cultural resonance of Chernobyl beyond
national borders. Music or art in general can be a platform where
artists draw upon significant world events or politics to make a
statement about an important issue. These songs were made to be
commercially successful and entertaining were definitely not intended as
thoughtful representations of the tragedy of Chernobyl. Despite
potential flaws in this, they are significant as popular works of music
which played upon the themes of distrust in nuclear power and fear of
environmental impact.
