## Introduction

Some catastrophes are an act of nature, and some are man-made. The repercussions for any catastrophe, however, are long lasting and can have a massive impact on many things—from the people involved to the tiniest creature or plant beneath our feet. Though we may not always consider it, nature can be affected just as strongly as humanity, and how people talk about nature in the context of catastrophe can be instrumental to understanding our own responses and views of events that have transpired. Using the Chernobyl disaster as a lens, and considering the following groupings of description, let us discuss perception of irradiated nature.

## Excerpt from "Abyssal Intimacies and Temporalities of Care" [^1]

"Prompted by a classroom discussion on knowledge politics in the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, this article offers a reading of Hugh Raffles' Insectopedia entry on Chernobyl. In that entry, Raffles describes how Swiss science-artist and environmental activist Cornelia Hesse- Honegger collects, studies, and paints morphologically deformed leaf bugs that she finds in proximity of nuclear power plants. In exploring how to begin to care about beings, such as leaf bugs, this article proposes a notion of care that combines an intimate knowledge practice with an ethical relationship to more-than-human others. Jacques Derrida's notion of 'abyssal intimacy' is central to such a combination. Hesse-Honegger's research practices enact and her paintings depict an 'abyssal intimacy' that deconstructs the oppositions between concerns about human suffering and compassion for seemingly irrelevant insects and between knowledge politics ethics. At the heart of such a careful knowledge production is a fundamental passivity, based on a shared vulnerability. An abyssal intimacy is not something we ought to recognize; rather, it issues from particular practices of care that do not identify their subjects of care in advance. Caring or becoming affected thus entails the dissociation of affection not only from the humanist subject, but also from movements in time: from direct helping action and from the assumption that advocacy necessarily means speaking for an other, usually assumed to be inferior.

The students responded emotionally; functional; relationships of co-dependence remained unconvincing but these relationships would not have been Raffles’ point: his entry is first of all about the vulnerability of leaf bugs and not (or only second) about their utility as possible biosensors for radiation risks to humans. But why would Raffles devote such a large portion of this chapter to Hesse-Honegger’s painting practice, and how did it relate to scientific expertise on the one hand, and forms of artistic expressions on the other, the students were wondering. In short, what has art to do with advocacy?

Under the microscope seeing becomes believing: Raffles (2010) quotes Hesse-Honegger, ‘Although I was theoretically convinced that radioactivity affects nature, I still could not imagine what it would actually look like. Now these poor creatures were lying there under my microscope. I was shocked’ (p. 21). While the deformities remained imperceptible to Raffles’ own untrained eyes, he reiterates, ‘[J]ust think, she says, what such and anomaly must feel, if you are only two tenths of an inch!’ (p. 15). Clearly imagining the pain of another takes some trained vision in this case. Even if empathy is always entangled with cognition as Lori Gruen (2012) suggests, it would require an initial emotional reaction. Can we imagine the pain of a leaf bug? (See Figure 1)."

## Excerpt from from *Wormwood Forest*[^2]

### PLUTONIUM SAFARI

"The zone in late autumn was a subtle landscape, painted with a cool palette of green pines, pale yellow fields, and silvery birches capped with a filigree of copper branches. Bare willows provided bright splashed of orange the framed the road on an unusually sunny and warm November afternoon."

## Conclusion

There are many ways in which people consider the aftermath of Chernobyl, and they can all be seen through looking at how we discuss the natural world as it relates to the disaster. Some view the affected areas as vulnerable, some beautiful, some morbid, and some as a large-scale change—perhaps it is all of these things, perhaps it is more than this, and perhaps it is nothing. However, Chernobyl altered the world irrevocably, and the only thing that matters now is what we choose to do about its effects.
