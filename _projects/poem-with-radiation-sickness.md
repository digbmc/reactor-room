excerpt: "'Chornobyl' does not mean Chornobylâ€”it is not big enough."
description: "How can we use something as small as words to describe something as expansive as apocalypse? 'Chornobyl Poem with Radiation Sickness' is an interactive text game that engages the impossibility of literature after catastrophe, challenging its players to innovate and work poetically as they tell the story of Chornobyl in a new way."
