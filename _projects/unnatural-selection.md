title:  "Unnatural Selection: The Truth About Radiation in Chernobyl's Animal Kingdom"
category: ['flora']
excerpt: "What mutated creatures are really roaming the radioactive forests of Chernobyl?"
description: "We often think about Chernobyl from a human perspective, but it's impact stretches much farther than that. People tend to acquire fanciful ideas about radiation, and the mutations of affected animals. In my project, I wanted to explore the truth behind radiation's affect on wildlife, and what mutations really look like here. I doing so, I hope the reader is able to view Chernobyl's influence from an entirely novel standpoint."
