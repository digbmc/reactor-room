## The Installation

This interactive exhibition seeks to facilitate public engagement with the Chornobyl catastrophe and its associated mythology. Students produced public-facing digital projects that investigate diverse aspects of Chornobyl’s cultural, environmental, social, and political consequences. As you navigate through this installation, you will encounter maps that visually trace the radioactive fallout from Chornobyl. You will meet some of the key figures who experienced, survived, and perpetrated one of the worst nuclear disasters in history. You will engage with the sounds and silences associated with Chornobyl. You will be taken on a virtual tour of street art in Prypiat, read annotated poetry translations, see the catastrophe through the paranoid lens of conspiracy theories, and consider the disaster’s ongoing and unquantifiable impact on plant and animal life. Individually, these projects are snapshots that reflect the fragmented narratives and memories of Chornobyl. Together, they invite you to become an active participant in the study of Chornobyl’s collective mythology.
