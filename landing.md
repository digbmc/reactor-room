It features work from students in Professor José Vergara’s course RUSSB220 Chornobyl taught at Bryn Mawr College (Fall 2023) and RUSS043 Chernobyl: Nuclear Narratives and the Environment at Swarthmore College (Spring 2020), as well as projects developed by the Bryn Mawr Digital Scholarship Summer Fellows (Summer 2023).
